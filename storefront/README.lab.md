## Phase 2 Requirements

In phase 2, we will be adding the “Add to Cart” feature to our application, which will allow our users to not only browse items in the store, but also select them and have them persist in their “shopping cart” for later purchase.

The user stories from Phase 1 remain unchanged. For this phase, we are now adding the following new user stories to meet the new requirements.

* As a user, I want to choose from products in the list and add them to my shopping cart
* As a user, I want to see the products that I’ve added to my shopping cart 
* As a user, I want to change the quantity of items I intend to purchase in my shopping cart
* As a user, I want to be able to remove an item from my shopping cart

## Technical Requirements / Notes

And as developers, here are the high level development tasks that address the above end user requirements

* Continue to use Material UI Components for layout and styling
* Add a “Cart” indicator to the header, like this: Cart (0)
* Create a new Cart component to show the items in the user’s cart
